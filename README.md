# Numerical Methods of Handling the Data
These include some implementations of such numerical methods as:
- Linear and Lagrange interpolation for Derivative computation
- Riemann integral computation
- Method of the Simple Iterations
- Seidel's method for matrices
- Gaussian elimination
- 2-dimentional surface integral computation

and a couple of others.
